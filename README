What are we going to do in this project :
We will be using House Pricing dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
You will Learn to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to Plot the one or more than one Features.
We will be using visualization techniques on dataset and get some meaningful insights.

EDA helps in first level of analysis of data.
We will analyse the data before making any intuition or assumptions, by plotting it.
